To obtain a stereo sound image, there are 2 channels (powered separately, having common ground).

Cheap Z80 procect boxes used for the case (and PCB size adjusted for these).

A test piece has already been built and used for recording a session.
Mikes were put into an accordeon (right hand keyboard only).

The next task is to replicate the build using a PCB.
