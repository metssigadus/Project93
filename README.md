Schematics:

There are some differences from the original ESP schematics. The schematics is redrawn so that "building block" pattern become prominently visible (current source, biasing).

To obtain the stereo sound image, 2 channels are in use (powered separately, having common ground).

Cheap Z80 procect boxes used for the case (and PCB size adjusted for these).

A test piece has already been built and used for recording a session.
Mikes were put into an accordeon (right hand keyboard only).

The next task is to replicate the build using a PCB.
